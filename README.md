# Construction_cost_prediction
This notebook is about construction cost prediction using the linear regression machine learning technique.
The dataset was collated from several secondary sources and combined into a single dataset.There are 117 construction information samples, covering different building types including residential,
commercial, institutional and educational, with construction period ranging from 2004 â€“ 2023.

The cost prediction model was built using the Linear Regression technique utilizing the python programming language within the Jupyter Notebook environment.
Data analysis was first carried out and this procedure involved the pre-processing, cleaning and preparation of the raw dataset, and performing exploratory data analysis.
The preprocessed dataset was then split into training and testing data. The ML model was trained and then tested for predicting the target feature, the Project Completion Cost.

The model created could predict construction cost at the early design stages of the project for 14 different building types defined in the model using predictor features such 
as building type, total floor area, number of floors, number of basements, etc.
